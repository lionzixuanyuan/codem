<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
  Codem is a free open source suite for converting video material from one format to another, as flexible and as scalable as possible.
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  Codem consists of two separate projects, the Scheduler and the Transcoder. The Scheduler handles the scheduling and handling of jobs, and the Transcoder
 	transcodes videos from one format to another. These two components communicate via a lightweight JSON api over HTTP. It's possible to use these two
	packages independently, but they are designed to work together. Read more about the architecture of Codem <a href="architecture/">here</a>.
