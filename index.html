<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
  Codem is a free open source suite for converting video material from one format to another, as flexible and as scalable as possible.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  Codem consists of two separate projects, the Scheduler and the Transcoder. The Scheduler handles the scheduling and handling of jobs, and the Transcoder transcodes videos from one format to another. These two components communicate via a lightweight JSON api over HTTP.
</p>

<h2>Why should I use it?</h2>
<p>
	These are the key features of Codem:
	<ol class="in">
		<li>it's easy to add new video formats</li>
		<li>it's easy to scale out by adding more Transcoders and/or Schedulers</li>
		<li>it's easy to extend</li>
	</ol>
</p>
