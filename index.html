<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
  Codem is an open source project, designed to convert video material from one format to another, as flexible and as scalable as possible.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  Codem consists of two separate projects, the Scheduler and the Transcoder. A Scheduler handles the scheduling and processing of jobs, and the Transcoder actually transcodes videos from one format to another.
</p>
<h3>The Scheduler</h3>
<p>
  The Scheduler is built in Ruby on Rails and consists of a frontend viewable in your browser, and an API to handle scheduling of jobs via the command line.

<h3>The Transcoder</h3>
<p>
  The Transcoder is a NodeJS server, handling the actual transcoding of jobs through ffmpeg.
