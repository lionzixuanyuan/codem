<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Codem is designed to be <strong>flexible</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> and <strong>robust</strong>. Flexible, since it's easy to extend, scalable, 
	since it's easy to add more Transcoders, and robust because each part of the system acts independently of the others.  Codem is built using open source technologies that have proven their value in various production environments.
</p>
<p>
	Codem consists of two separate packages which communicate via a JSON api. The Scheduler is built in Ruby on Rails and deals with scheduling and handling
	of jobs. The Transcoder is built in NodeJS and handles the actual transcoding of videos through ffmpeg. Both packages can be used independently and
	provide a simple JSON api themselves. In case you need more transcoding power, it's easy to set up more Transcoder instances. Just set up
	another Transcoder, add it to the Scheduler, and it will start to accept jobs.
</p>

<h3>The Scheduler</h3>
<p>
	The Scheduler is responsible for handling the jobs and distributing them over the Transcoders. It does so by keeping track of the state a job is in and 
	communicating with the Transcoders. Eventually, a job will either succeed or fail. When this happens, the Scheduler is capable of sending out notifications
	via email or the web.

<p>
	The Scheduler needs to know where to find the Transcoder instances. This can be done by adding Hosts to the Scheduler via the API or the web front end.
	Parameters to ffmpeg, such as width, height, output format and such can be added to the Scheduler by creating a Preset via the API or the web front end.
